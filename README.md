### Description

- This algorithm is designed for an online learning scenario, where the MLP (student) learns to predict correct regression outputs like a teacher perceptron.
- The student perceptron updates its synaptic vector based on an estimate of the distribution of the teacher's post-synaptic field. This is the key difference from previous algorithms like Caticha-Kinouchi that assume a uniform distribution.
- The distribution is estimated using a parallel ensemble of student perceptrons learning simultaneously. Their synaptic vectors are averaged to cancel out noise.
- The Fourier transform of the characteristic function of the teacher is estimated numerically to get the distribution. This allows learning teachers beyond the typical case.
